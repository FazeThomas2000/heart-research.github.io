                            My name is Afolakemi Akinrefon, and I’m originally from Indianapolis, Indiana. I’m currently a fourth-year student at UC, majoring in Medical Sciences and minoring in Public Health. 
                            I’m passionate about this work because I believe it’s crucial to share health-related information with the community in ways that can make a real impact, especially through formats that go beyond the usual methods. 
                            I think this approach helps keep people engaged and enables them to better understand and apply the information to their lives.
